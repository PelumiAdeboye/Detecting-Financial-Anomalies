# Detecting-Financial-Anomalies
This code is used to detect anomalies in financial transactions. It uses Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor models to predict anomalies in the data. The code loads the sample financial transaction data, separates out the features and labels of the dataset, initializes both models with certain parameters, fits both models on the data, predicts anomalies using both models and combines predictions from both models to get final prediction. Finally it assigns the predicted labels to original dataset and prints out the results.
